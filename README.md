This page is a UI for adding to and deleting from a database of users with various feilds.
It lets you connect and make GET, POST, and DELETE http requests directly through the UI.
On the left side there are inputs to create a new user with their name, email, user type, and department. 
A list of all the users the server is saving is stored on the right side, which allows you to delete individaul users as well as all the users at once.
