Glitch Page: https://glitch.com/~a2-amarrinan

This page is a UI for adding to and deleting from a database of users with various feilds.
It lets you connect and make GET, POST, and DELETE http requests directly through the UI.
On the left side there are inputs to create a new user with their name, email, user type, and department. 
A list of all the users the server is saving is stored on the right side, which allows you to delete individaul users as well as all the users at once.

Technical Achievment:
(5 points) Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.

Design Achievment:
(5 points per person, with a max of 10 points) Test your user interface with other students in the class. Define a specific task for them to complete (ideally something short that takes <10 minutes), and then use the think-aloud protocol to obtain feedback on your design (talk-aloud is also fine). Important considerations when designing your study:
